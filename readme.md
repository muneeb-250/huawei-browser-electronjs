# 🚀 Introducing the ElectronJS Browser Blast-Off! 🚀

Say hello to a sleek and simple browser built with ElectronJS ⚛️, packed with some essential features like the power to reload pages and travel back in time (AKA, "go back" functionality).

But wait, there's more! We've added some handy websites to the file menu, split into three exciting categories: Search Engines, Utils, and Enjoy. So you can quickly access your go-to sites and get on with your day.

And the best part? This browser is totally private! You can keep your browsing habits to yourself.

We want this project to be open source and continue to grow, so feel free to fork it and add your own flair to it. Let's see what amazing new functionalities we can add to this browser together! 🚀
